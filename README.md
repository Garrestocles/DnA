CatHack
=======

Currently all you can do is wander about a randomly generated dungeon.  There's also a cat that follows you around and when it finds you it just kind of walks/lays about around where you are.  But, you don't have to do all this alone, as player2.html allows an arbitray number of persons to join you in your meanderings!

Requires Node to run.
  Need to npm install socket.io and express.
  
FYI: This code is currently pretty hacky, as I was in "just make it work" mode (or should I say "agile developement").  Also, I haven't tested it yet personally, but I didn't put in any manner of input validation, so I'm fairly certain that this is probably vulnerable, so watch out for that.  Good thing hackers are a myth...right?
