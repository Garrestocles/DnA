DnA (Dungeons & ASCII)
=======

The ultimate goal of this project is to serve as an ASCII tabletop for playing pen & paper-esce RPGs.  The first goal is to essentially make it at least as good as having a laminated sheet of dry erase paper for a map and dice to represent characters.

Requires Node and  npm to run.

To start, run the following commands:
```Bash
  npm install
  node app.js
```
  
FYI: This code is currently pretty hacky, as I was in "just make it work" mode (or should I say "agile developement").  Also, I haven't tested it yet personally, but I didn't put in any manner of input validation, so I'm fairly certain that this is probably vulnerable, so watch out for that.  Good thing hackers are a myth...right?
